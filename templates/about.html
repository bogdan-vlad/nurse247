                You work in partnership when you
                involve the individual and their family
                and work alongside other workers. The
                key to a successful partnership is good
                communication and trust; valuing and
                respecting what others have to say.</p>

                    Treating somebody in
                    a dignified way means to treat
                    someone with respect, valuing their
                    individuality and their ethical and
                    moral beliefs. In order to provide
                    dignified care you need to have an
                    open and positive attitude.

                    Respecting someone means believing
                    and showing that they have importance
                    as an individual. It means that they
                    have their own opinions and feelings
                    and that even though you may not
                    agree with them, you do respect them.
